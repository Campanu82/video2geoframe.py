# video2geoframes.py

Python program to generate a collection of geotagged images from a video and a GPS track.

Designed for contribution to street-level imagery projects like Mapillary or Panoramax.

## Notes

This program was originally designed for personal use to contribute to Mapillary and now to Panoramax with a smartphone
(video mode) or a dashcam.

This v1 is the last version of the original code, published "as it is" with certain known bugs and limitations.

Since June 2024, a v2 was started to develop with the aim of :
* enhance performances
* fix known bugs
* clean code
* remove non-Python dependencies
* implement more flexible configuration with TOML.
